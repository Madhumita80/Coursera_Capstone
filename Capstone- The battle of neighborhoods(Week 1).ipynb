Opening a mini-grocery store can be a lucrative business venture if it can be opened in a secure place with little competition. When people are looking for specialty foods or ingredients that can't be found at the corner store or neighborhood supermarket, they typically head to small grocers. Such retail establishments sell food and items that are uncommon or not carried by bigger stores. \n    The problem will be approached in two phases: First, the safe borough would be selected for opening the store by analyzing the crime data of Vancouver city neighborhoods. Second, the data science tools learned in this course, will be used to explore the neighborhood of the safest borough and the ten most common venues in each neighbourhood. Based on the results of most common venues, proposal will be placed to the stakeholders as to in which neighborhood the store can be opened .</p>"
